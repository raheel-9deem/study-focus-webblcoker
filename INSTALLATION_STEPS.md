**Privacy**: All data stays on your device, never sent anywhere

### ✓ Alarms
**Why**: Keep timer running even when popup is closed
**Privacy**: Just sets local timers, no data collection

### ✓ Notifications
**Why**: Alert you when focus session completes
**Privacy**: Local notifications only, no external services

### ✓ Tabs
